/* NOTES

JS is single threaded in which everything is a process.

********** Java Excecution Context 
JEC means how javascript executes a .js file, it basically executes the file in two phases which are MEMORY CREATION PHASE and 
EXECUTION PHASE

Global Excecution Context
Function Execution Context
Eval Execution Context

so each file will definitely have Global Excecution Context which contains 'this' means current object, keep this in mind that 
global object in case of browser is windows object.
